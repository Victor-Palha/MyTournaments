# MyTournaments
This is a simple api to manage tournaments. It is written in Node.js and uses NestJS as a framework along with Typescript.

## Why?
I created this project to help my local yu-gi-oh community to manage their tournaments and can be used by any other community that needs to manage their tournaments.

## Has a frontend?
Not yet, but I'm planning to create a frontend using Vue.js or React.js.

## The architecture
The project is using a clean architecture, so it is easy to change the database or the framework used. Thats why i'm also using Domain Driven Design to separate the business logic from the framework.

## Tests
The project is using Vitest to run the tests. To run the tests, just run the command `npm run test`.
Also all features that are created i did a TDD approach.
